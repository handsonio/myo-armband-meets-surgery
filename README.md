# Myo Armband meets Surgery !

This repository contains the code of a prototype we have made in order to demonstrate a concrete use-case of the Myo Armband technology, in this case using it as a input device for the surgeon or a member of the medical crew in a surgery room.

This time we investigate a concrete use case and how the technology can be used to interact with computer without actually touching them ! For a short period of time, we are going to put ourselves in the shoes of a surgeon.
